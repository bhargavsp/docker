# Docker

## Why we need Docker
If we want to run the different servicess to build an end to end application stack we need a different `libraries and the Dependencies` and each time we change the version of the services by upgrades, we need to check the OS compartibility, to overcome this scenarios we have introduced Docker as it is a container based architecture in which each container have its own lib and dep by itself<br/>
